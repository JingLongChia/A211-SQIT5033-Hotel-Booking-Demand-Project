## Introduction to Dataset

We will use the Hotel Booking Demand dataset from the Kaggle.

You can download it from here: https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand

This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has from the data.


## Problem Statement

With the increase trend of cancellation from year to year, some hotel have think that high cancellation in hotel is the new norm of the industry which is a completely wrong approach, one out of four hotel guests are cancelling hotel booking ahead of a stay. This cancellation trend has effect the hotel not being able to accurately forecast occupancy within their revenue management, and the trend of cancellation also have causes hotel loss in opportunity cost (unsold room due to cancellation).


## Hypothesis



## Goals

1. The Goals of this project is to find out the characteristic of customers who cancelled and finding a pattern in cancelled booking by doing an exploratory data analysis.

2. Building descriptive data mining to determine the data regularities and predictive data mining to predict cancellation.

3. Build and Deploy web application / dashboard using Streamlit from predictive data mining, that can predict of cancellation based on user input.
